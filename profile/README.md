## Mission:
As students of [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), acting as the Red Team under the banner of Binary Bandits 01, our mission is to embark on a practical penetration testing project that enhances our understanding of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Our collaborative effort aims to provide a valuable learning experience as we simulate real-world cyber threats and defenses.

<br>

## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive red team security assessment on behalf of Simcorp to evaluate the effectiveness of their cybersecurity defenses. Our team, has been contracted to simulate real-world cyberattacks and assess the client's readiness to defend against them.
